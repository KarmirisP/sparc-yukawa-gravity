Updated GitHub Instructions for KarmirisP
Repository Creation
When you create the repository at https://github.com/KarmirisP, name it: sparc-yukawa-gravity
Updated README.md for your repository:
markdown# SPARC Galaxy Rotation Curve Analysis with Yukawa-Modified Gravity

This repository contains the Python code used in the paper "A Universal Gravitational Modification Scale from the SPARC Galaxy Database" by P. Karmiris (2025).

## Overview

This code analyzes 175 galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database, comparing:
- Yukawa-modified gravity models (CGF, TF, Basic Yukawa)  
- Standard ΛCDM with NFW dark matter halos

Key finding: The Yukawa modification scale λ ≈ 0.57 kpc is universal across all galaxy types.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- See requirements.txt for complete list

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarmirisP/sparc-yukawa-gravity.git
cd sparc-yukawa-gravity
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Download SPARC data from http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/
Place .txt files in data/ directory
Run analysis:

bashpython sparc_analysis.py data/ --output_dir results/
